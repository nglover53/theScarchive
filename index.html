When I was 18, I had a breast augmentation because I felt like I had to make my chest look a certain way, but it didn't bring me any comfort or euphoria, and I ended up binding my chest for 5 years as I grew into my identity and decided what was best for me. Having top surgery allowed me to breath (literally at times from not having to bind). I personally love my scars and can't imagine my chest without them."</p>
